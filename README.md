# 🚨(THIS LIBRARY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Benitmulindwa/safi2D.git
```
## Usage
```python
from safi2D.safi import Canvas

HEIGHT = 400
WIDTH = 600

curve = Canvas(WIDTH, HEIGHT)

# Draw a red circle
curve.draw_filled_circle(center=(WIDTH // 2, HEIGHT // 2), radius=80, color=(255, 0, 0))

curve.save("outputs/filled_circle.png")
```
This draws a red circle on a white background.
### Output:
<img src="outputs/filled_circle.png" width=600 height=400>
